/* math game requirements:
 * 1. open with a menu prompting the user for their name, followed by choosing one of the 4 operators
 * 
 * 2. for each operator, two random numbers should be generated, prompting the user to solve displayed equations
 * 
 * 3. they should loop until the user inputs the wrong answer, with exceptions handled (putting a letter instead of a number)
 * 
 * 4. the divisions must result in integers only, with dividends being 0-100??(come back to that one)
 * 
 * 5. any games played should be stored in some kind of list, which the user can view, no need for db tho
